## User Experience (UX)

The end user of this project will be fans of the mythical and historical ethos of Ireland.

It is aimed at people wanting to travel all over Ireland to visit it's oldest and strangest landsites, while learning something of the locations back-stories along with the journey.

### User Stories

* As a user I want to be shown a visual glimpse of the location.
* As a user I want to be able to find out background and historical information on each attraction.
* As a user I want to be shown where each attraction can be found on google maps.
* As a user I want to be to follow the website through social media to easily keep up to date on any new attractions added or functions added to the website.
* As a user I want to be able to navigate the site easily whether accessing through my mobile or laptop.
* As a user I want to be able to get in touch to ask questions about the attractions and their surrounding areas.

### Design

- ####    Colour Scheme
    - The colours used for the website were chosen for the colours of the Irish flag. Colours of Green, White and Orange. The colours will hopefully put the users of the site in the mood to become immersed in all things Irish, whether that be foreign tourists or Irish people looking to discover more about their roots.

- ####    Typography
    - The main font I have chosen is 'Oswald' as it is easy to read and stands out. I will use sans-serif as a backup font.

    - The secondary font used is 'Quattrocento' to help headings and titles to stand out from the rest of the text and to give the headings a scriptive look.

- ####    Images
    - The main use of images for this website will be the ones used to depict the locations. (https://unsplash.com)

    - For the hero-image I have chosen the image of a castle atop an overgrown hill in the foreground, with the open sea taking up the background. This will hopefully ignite in the user a feeling of openess and adventure.

    - Other images constist of small icon images taken from (https://fontawesome.com/v4.7/) to represent the social media links.

- ####    Wireframes
    - All wireframes were made using MockFlow.com. I have left up my original wireframes to show how the project changed shape as I worked through it.

## Features

### Common Features

* Header - provides users with easy navigation throughout the webpage.
    - The navigation menu is positioned in the header because this is the most common location for it meaning the user will know exactly where to find it.
    - I chose to leave the header blended ontop of the hero-image to make the hero-image priority when it comes to attracting the user's eye when first accessing the website.
* Links/Buttons - Any links hovered over will respond.
    - The page navigation links in the header and images will change colour to an orange colour (#E39105) and will grow in size using the hvr-grow class found at https://designlink.work/hover-css/
    - The social media images will also change an orange colour (#E39105) when hovered over.
* Hero-image
    - For the hero-image I have chosen the image of a castle atop an overgrown hill in the foreground, with the open sea taking up the background. This will hopefully ignite in the user a feeling of openess and adventure.
* Footer
    - The footer has been designed to look a bit plainer when compared to the rest of the webpage as I want the rest of the page to stand out.
    - The social media links take center stage of the footer to encourage the user to follow any changes to the site on social media.
